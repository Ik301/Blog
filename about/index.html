<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Isaac, and this blog is my online notebook.</p>
<p>I'm a student at Princeton University, where I study Financial Engineering and Philosophy—a combination that often gets a curious look, but one that sits at the very heart of this project. It began in 2022 as a place to document my learnings, but has since evolved into something more: an exploration of the connections that bind all fields of human experience.</p>
<p>This space is dedicated to the convergence of three fundamental domains: the intellectual, the personal, and the spiritual.</p>
<h1>The Philosophy</h1>
<p>I believe that every field of human endeavor—from physics to poetry, theology to technology—is an attempt to understand a single, underlying truth—God. Each discipline is a different language trying to describe the same ineffable reality. Each identity is a unique lens through which to see the same light.</p>
<p>This is the convergence I seek to explore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Intellectual is the realm of logic, analysis, and structured knowledge. It’s the &quot;how&quot; and the &quot;what.&quot; Here, you’ll find technical breakdowns of AI models, summaries of paradigm-shifting books, and strategic guides for navigating complex systems. It is the pursuit of clarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Personal is the realm of lived experience, emotion, and identity. It’s the &quot;who.&quot; This is where my poetry on belonging, essays on relationships, and reflections on my own journey live. It is the pursuit of authenticity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spiritual is the realm of meaning, purpose, and our connection to something larger than ourselves. It’s the ultimate &quot;why.&quot; This undercurrent shapes my questions about what makes a life well-lived and my conviction that all paths of inquiry can lead back to a single, creative source. It is the pursuit of meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blog is my process of collecting and connecting the dots between these worlds. It is an invitation for you to do the same. Whether you leave with a new insight, a lingering question, or simply a moment of quiet contemplation, my goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Thank you for thinking alongside me.</p>
