        <p>#Poetry #Reflection
Award: Gold Key (Scholastic Art and Writing Awards – Nationals)</p>
<p>Intro: Many are afraid to address their flaws and shortcomings. However, improvement and development only come by addressing these problems and facing one’s fears. This poem aims to address the stigma around our flaws and encourage embracing our flaws</p>
<p>Peer deep into the abyss, where shadows dance and sway,
And in that murky void, the abyss meets your gaze.</p>
<p>A skeletal ghost, haunting the realms of time,
Yearning for redemption, a chance to heal the prime.</p>
<p>Haunting us all, regrets gnaw at our soul.</p>
<p>Within ourselves, it lies, that darkness to explore,
Rotted at the core, a festering wound we can’t ignore.</p>
<p>Abyssal depths within, a reflection of our soul,
A battle fought within, to mend and make us whole.</p>
<p>In the depths of despair, memories long repressed,
A whispered plea for solace, a chance for grace to shine.</p>
<p>The abyss beckons softly, a tempest in disguise,
Yet amidst the darkness, a glimmering truth may arise.</p>
<p>Embrace the haunting specter, let it guide your way,
For within its skeletal frame, wisdom holds its sway.</p>
<p>Redemption’s elusive touch, a balm for wounds that bleed,
As we confront our shadows, the darkest parts we need.</p>
<p>So gaze into the abyss, let it mirror your strife,
Unveiling the raw essence, the truth beneath life.</p>
<p>Embrace the fragility, flaws we can’t ignore,
And through redemption’s journey, our spirit can restore.</p>
