        <p>#Poetry #Time #Longing</p>
<p>Award: Silver Key (Scholastic Art and Writing Awards)</p>
<p>Intro: This work aims to explore the fragility and transience of human existence. Oftentimes, we are overwhelmed and trapped by the shadows of our past, overlooking the invaluable essence of time. Exploring the conquest of regret and the acceptance of time's ephemerality, the poem seeks to unravel a universally relatable theme.</p>
<p>Chained by the world's order.
The grip that holds all.</p>
<p>The waves in the ocean, the flowers in the field.
Fragile, transient.</p>
<p>Time, Waits for none, stops for none. Time, the bane of all.
A sorrowful surrender, A past of regrets. The tears of Niobe, how they plague my soul.</p>
<p>Nay, nay, cease thy sorrow. ‘Tis but the laws of the world, The chain that binds us all.
Cease thy struggles, The futile resistance. Even the gods, yoked to the chains.
So cry no more, Regret no more.</p>
<p>Beyond the waves, the sun rises another day. Beyond the flowers, seeds spring new life.
Think not of days to end, but of days to come.
Every ending, a new beginning.</p>
<p>Time so precious, cease thy squander.
Nay, nay, chained no more.
Break thy chains, restrained no more.</p>
