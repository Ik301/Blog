        <p>#Poetry #Solitude</p>
<p>He who breathes in the still of night,
Who is he, in the absence of light.
With nobody to see, nobody to hear,
Who is he, but a man alone with his fear.</p>
<p>He cries to God, one who bottles his tears.
Tears they fall, but where is God
Not in his fears.</p>
<p>He cries to man, one who shares his bone.
Stones they hail, but where is man
Not in his fears.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, he cries to self.
Neither God nor man
Not in his fears.</p>
<p>He who weeps in the still of night,
Who is he, drowning in plight.
With nobody to see, nobody to hear,
Who is he, but a man alone in his fear.</p>
