        <p>#Poetry #Longing #Time</p>
<p>I envision a man, gently rowing his boat
Wooden oars gliding through his passage</p>
<p>I envision a cherry blossom, adorning the branches of fate
Silently adored by a pensive gaze</p>
<p>I envision the river, flowing once more
Petals of the tree, flying once more
Gaze of the man, set straight once more</p>
<p>But I see the flowers caressing our sky
Even as he rows along, a petal lands on the wooden oar</p>
<p>Though the man set his sights ahead,
Breeze of memories ripples his river</p>
<p>Upon looking back, he is greeted by
Sakura of memories, fluttering across the sky
Branches of fate, waving across its river
Waters calmed, now a tranquil still</p>
<p>Petals once adored have been adjourned,
To when unbeknownst to man.
But for now, the man lay down his oar,
Rising with melancholy
Of sakura once admired on its branch.</p>
