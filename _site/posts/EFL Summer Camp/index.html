<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This summer, I had the privilege of attending the EFL Cornell Summer camp, a transformative week-long camp focused on developing leadership and economic skills. Even as I write this blog post, I am overwhelmed with emotions of gratitude and thanks to all who made this camp a life-changing experience. I hope to share my experiences, thoughts, and gratitude through this blog post.</p>
<p>As an overnight college camp, many elements contributed to creating this wonderful experience. The camp had three main components: economics classes, leadership activities, and recreation. All these pieces came together to paint the unforgettable experience at EFL.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>One of the main focuses of this camp was to nurture our growth as economists. This goal was achieved through a series of captivating and informative lectures and activities. Professor Kessler, a Senior Lecturer of Economics at Purdue University Fort Wayne, led the lectures for the week. His use of anecdotes and interactive activities made the lectures both captivating and interesting. The activities pushed us to apply the economic concepts we had just learned, helping us internalize the knowledge. Professor Kessler's approachable nature encouraged student participation, and he was always eager to answer questions. The use of Peardecks and infographics made the content surprisingly accessible. Overall, I felt myself growing as an economist, thanks to the professor and my fellow classmates.</p>
<h2>Leadership Activities</h2>
<p>The highlight of the camp was undoubtedly the leadership activities. The primary purpose of this camp was to help us discover and grow as leaders, and it excelled in achieving this goal. Each day presented us with a multitude of leadership activities that pushed us to our limits. We were forced to self-reflect and evaluate ourselves as leaders and as individuals. Activities like the Trust Reach built camaraderie and trust among us, while others, like the Swamp, forced us in leadership roles. This daily barrage of challenges enabled me to develop a leadership mindset and reflect on my own abilities as a leader.</p>
<h2>Recreation</h2>
<p>The recreational activities played a substantial role in creating a supportive community within our camp. We engaged in a variety of recreational activities, including soccer (a camp favorite), movies, bowling, card games, and more. Through these activities, we got to know each other, shared our experiences, and built trust among ourselves. The recreational activities significantly contributed to quickly forming strong connections among the campers. Despite the one-week time constraint, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I connected with a lot of different people.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My time at the EFL Summer Camp has nurtured a leadership and growth mindset within me. The camp provided me with the opportunity to reflect, expand my comfort zone, and grow as a leader. Even now, I'm filled with gratitude for my classmates and the staff who joined me on this journey of growth. This camp has been a life-altering experience for me, and I wholeheartedly encourage any aspiring economist and leader to join EFL for a week of transformation.</p>
