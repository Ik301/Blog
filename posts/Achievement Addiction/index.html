        <p>#Essay #Blog</p>
<p>Award: Honorable Mention (Scholastic Art and Writing Awards)</p>
<p>Intro: Mounting societal pressures place an unbearable burden on teens, leading to an epidemic of detrimental mental health issues. This essay explores the pervasive mental health issue of accomplished teens correlating and deriving their self-worth from their accolades.</p>
<p>Facing today’s youth is a global epidemic of mental health issues. Due to mounting societal pressures and expectations, today’s talented young individuals are correlating their achievements with self-worth. Growing up in a society where the grades one achieves, accolades they obtain, and the university they attend is valued more than one’s well being, many are crushed under the invisible, yet suffocating pressures of society. Being expected to give up one’s passions for “socially accepted accomplishments,” many young people sacrifice their mental health for marginal gains in achievements. Due to this unending cycle of chasing after accomplishments, many high-achievers are deriving their self-worth from their accomplishments. When high-achievers meet the expectations placed on them, they maintain a strong mental state. However, the problem occurs when they fail to meet the expectations placed on them by others and themselves. One will inevitably face a seemingly insurmountable wall, and it’s under this setback that the mental state of high-achievers crumbles. Because they derived their self-worth from their achievements, their self-esteem and confidence will crumble in the face of challenges they can’t overcome. As a problem stemming from societal norms and impacting the lives of many, the tendency to correlate self-worth with achievements is a silent curse, eating away at the lives of many.</p>
<p>With the rise of social media, many youth have felt the social pressure to succeed in a visible manner. In a society flooded with stories of successful people, young individuals are presented with the daunting task of achieving the same level of success. Given this impossible task, many outright give-up and fail, but those that embark on the path to “success” are praised. This cycle of praise for visible success and scorn for seemingly disappointing results implant a dangerous mindset into young students: success at any cost. Sacrificing one’s time, happiness, and even health, many young people chase after tangible achievements and accolades. Drunk on societal approval and praise, these high-achievers search for more, work for more, and accomplish more, building up their identity based on their achievements. The dangers of forming an identity based on accomplishments is clear: one becomes fragile to setbacks. As beautiful the glass castle of accomplishments may be, in the end, it’s glass. Once someone yokes their identity to their accomplishments, their identity is shattered in the face of adversity. Because failure and defeat are inevitable, those high-achievers face an inevitable identity crisis. Having built their whole lives around their accomplishments, many find it hard or even impossible to overcome the identity crisis, leading to various mental health issues.</p>
<p>Tantamount to a life-threatening crisis, the inability to overcome a challenge debilitates the high-achiever’s ability to perceive oneself in a positive light. Because success and achievements are so fundamental to their identity, facing an insurmountable wall, their mental health crumbles. Unable to rationalize their self-worth through accomplishments, they develop dangerously low self esteem and confidence. Without the accomplishments that they got praised for, the high-achievers feel as if they got stripped of their talent and purpose in life. However, the negative mental health effects begin even before facing the unconquerable challenges. Every day, the high-achievers are expected to exert every ounce of their energy into striving for more accomplishments. Under this high-intensity environment where they are drained physically, emotionally, and mentally, they are subject to dangerously high levels of stress. Living under the constant pressure, these young students are subject to weak mental and emotional health.</p>
<p>In a relentless pursuit of perfection where 99% is never enough and sleep becomes an afterthought, the dominance of this pursuit can consume one’s existence. Like many in the younger generation, I too have grappled with the societal pressure to succeed, a pressure so pervasive that it often surpasses concerns for one’s health. Growing up surrounded by a multitude of high-achievers, including my father with a PhD and friends frequenting award ceremonies, I constantly felt the weight of comparison. Amidst these outstanding individuals, I stuck out like a sore thumb. While I might be considered “above-average” or “smart” in other contexts, in my environment, I was deemed nothing more than “average” – the embodiment of mediocrity. Faced with high expectations from both peers and myself, I poured my heart and soul into studying and self-improvement. Shifting my priorities away from social, emotional, and physical health, I began amputating anything that hindered me from achieving my goals. From spending time with friends to ensuring proper sleep, nothing remained untouched. These radical measures brought recognition and acceptance; peers and mentors praised me. However, once the cycle of achievement and praise commenced, turning back became impossible. Each day, the expectation to outperform previous accomplishments became an insurmountable challenge. Facing diminishing returns, I sacrificed more each day. Soon, I became the “standard” for my peers – doing worse than me was expected, and doing better was a cause for celebration. Essentially, I found myself competing alone against the entire school. With this excruciating amount of pressure, I saw my own deterioration –  dark circles deepening, mood swings intensifying, and my self-esteem sinking lower. At its peak, even achieving a perfect grade left me disappointed, questioning if I could have done better. Under constant pressure and lacking self-care, I finally shattered. A single test grade became the catalyst, making me envision myself as unworthy and a disappointment to those with high expectations. My personal journey is a testament to the profound impact a high-pressure environment can have on the mental health of many youths today.</p>
<p>Due to the expansive and complex nature of the problem, there isn’t a perfect solution that will help everyone, but there are some practices to promote better well-being. The first step is advocating for a more inclusive definition of success. In today’s society, success exclusively revolves around achievements and grades, neglecting recognition of personal growth or happiness and well-being. By broadening the definition of success, today’s youth can realize that personal growth and attaining happiness are forms of success. Rather than sacrificing personal development and happiness for the narrow definition of “success,” they can harmonize academic success and personal development under the broader definition of success. Furthermore, today’s youth must understand that every individual is multifaceted—grades and achievements alone aren’t enough to define anyone. Because everyone is made up of more than the trophies they hang on their walls, one’s achievements are an insufficient measure to evaluate self-worth. While accepting this truth can be challenging due to societal expectations and biases towards visible accomplishments, it can be achieved through a cultural shift that celebrates the depth of human attributes. Finally, it is vital for today’s young generation to realize that success can only be achieved with a healthy mind and body. It’s physically, mentally, and emotionally impossible to attain success with a crumbling body. While striving for improvement and better grades is commendable, it shouldn’t come at the cost of one’s well-being. Through these various practices, the pressing problem of individuals correlating their achievements with self-worth can be addressed.</p>
<p>As a community leader who has personally experienced the social pressures to succeed and been affected by them, I am dedicated to creating an environment where individuals can liberate themselves from these burdens. In my community, I address this issue by shifting the focus from “achieving” to “exploring.” Emphasizing the exploration of one’s passions and dreams, rather than fixating on achievements, fosters better mental health and balance. Many high-achievers are often misled into thinking that they must sacrifice either their passions or their success and achievements. Contrary to this, I firmly believe that achievements and success can be found in pursuing one’s passions. To promote this belief, I have initiated various programs and supported different organizations that encourage the exploration of one’s passions. For example, through my Investment Book Club and Investment Club, I provide a supportive environment for members to cultivate their passion for finance and investments. Bay Gives Back, another initiative of mine, offers a space for members to advance their passion for service and aid. Furthermore, my volunteering at Discover World serves as an excellent example of how I assist others in kindling and exploring their passions. By exposing patrons to scientific wonders and innovations, I contribute to the development and growth of their love for the sciences. As I gain more experience and encounter additional opportunities, my goal is to utilize them to guide others away from the narrow definition of “success” and towards a path of exploring their passions.</p>
<p>The pervasive issue facing today’s youth—an epidemic of mental health challenges exacerbated by societal pressures—is complex and multifaceted. The impact is profound, affecting not only high-achievers but the broader youth population. The dangers posed by forming an identity formed solely around achievements are evident, making individuals fragile to setbacks. The rise of social media has intensified the pressure to succeed visibly, fostering a mindset that prioritizes success at any cost. This pursuit often leads to sacrificing essential elements of life—time, happiness, and health—resulting in a dangerous identity built solely on achievements. My personal academic journey emphasizes the toll of this relentless pursuit of perfection, where even a perfect grade can leave one disappointed. The call to action is clear—to redefine success, promote a more inclusive definition that values personal growth and happiness alongside traditional achievements. As a community leader, my commitment is to create environments where individuals can liberate themselves from societal burdens. Shifting the focus from “achieving” to “exploring” allows for a more balanced and mentally healthy approach. Today’s youth are faced with a brutal society where individual worth is defined by their accolades, and failure to address this pressing issue will result in a generation grappling with severe mental health consequences.</p>
