        <p>We walked that path, side by side.</p>
<p>We greeted the birds, singing sorrows away.
We woke the sun, sharing our day.</p>
<p>We sang those songs, moving our sway.
We shared those days, hoping it'll stay.
/
I walk that path, step by step.</p>
<p>I greet the birds, singing in daze.
I wake the sun, bringing lonely days.</p>
<p>I sing these songs, hanging my lips,
I hate these days, facing its grips.
/
Do you walk, down that path?</p>
<p>Greet those birds, wake the sun?
Sing those songs, make the day?
/
It's not us, you're no more.
It's not me, not anymore.</p>
<p>So who is that, walking our path?</p>
