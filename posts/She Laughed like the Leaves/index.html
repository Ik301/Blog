        <p>&quot;Let's live, just for today.&quot;</p>
<p>That day, I learned leaves could laugh.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Maybe it was fate, a twisted joke for the Weavers. But I don't believe in fate, not any more.</p>
<p>It was serendipity. A blowing of winds.</p>
<p>Truly, a blowing of winds.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Dante's Inferno never felt so real. His artistic craft, flowing lines, revolting imagery … no it was the heat.</p>
<p>A heat that seeps through your nose and chokes the life from your throat. A heat that claws at your skin, sticky hands from the crevices of hell.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Before slipping into its grasp, a ruffling of hair, lifting of garments.</p>
<p>Murmuring a thanks, I lifted my gaze. But meeting mine, was Hers.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>I said I didn't believe in fate. But that moment, no other word could describe.</p>
<p><em>Ephemeral</em>.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Unrestrained smile, free from the ashes of man.</p>
<p>Dewy eyes, glistening drops of light.</p>
<p>Perky ears, inviting the weary at heart.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>That was me, weary at heart.</p>
<p>Though, not just at heart, apparently.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>&quot;Did you know, when you stop speaking, the world starts whispering.&quot;</p>
<p>Before I could stutter a response, She grasped my hands and laid my lids.</p>
<p>&quot;Shhh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just listen.&quot;</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Carried by Her melody, I drifted into a world unseen.</p>
<p>Soaring blues were birds,
Choreographing their dance before parting 'til chance.</p>
<p>Storming plants were ants,
Each to their due, united accrue.</p>
<p>Breathing life were trees,
A constant flow: noticed by none, needed by all.</p>
<p>Simplest of life, clothed by Creation.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Leaves, reaching for Her touch.</p>
<p>Birds, calling for Her love.</p>
<p>Wind, dancing for Her silk.</p>
<p>Sun, yearning for Her glow.</p>
<p>Greeting me was Her visage.</p>
<p><em>Immortal</em>.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>&quot;No one rebukes the birds for roaming the skies. Nor the ants for working their mounds. Who could breathe, if not for the silent trees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So why try to be, something you're not?&quot;</p>
<p>With a grin, She turned Her back.</p>
<p>But not before adding, &quot;Your face said it all.&quot;</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>As Her steps grew smaller, I chased with conviction.</p>
<p>I was a Yo-Yo, She was the hand.</p>
<p>She beckoned me forth, I yielded my path.</p>
<p>Their Strings worked, in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>&quot;You know, I've always wanted to ride a bike.&quot;</p>
<p>With a childish squeal, She leaned back. Ebony silk brushed strokes in the sky.</p>
<p>Under such a sky, I hunched forward. Precision with every step, I cycled.</p>
<p>&quot;One, two, three. One, two, three.&quot;</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Breaking my cadence, She leaned forward and whispered, &quot;Isn't the river beautiful?&quot;</p>
<p>River? What river? Were we biking by a river?</p>
<p>Unconvinced by my hesitant, &quot;Yeah …&quot;, She sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the point of biking if you're not going to enjoy it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While you're hunched forward, squinting your eyes, life is moving by.&quot;</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>One, two. One …</p>
<p>Gears grinding to a halt, I looked back.</p>
<p>Not at how far I've come, but how much I've missed. Lilacs coloring the green, salmon jumping the bank, children picnicking by the shade.</p>
<p>Since when did biking become so technical? Where did the love, my childish love, go?</p>
<p>Rushing down the neighborhood hill, running from homework, ripping through the trails.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>&quot;Let yourself go. By the time you're at the finish line, it'll be too late.&quot;</p>
<p>Seeing Her so serious, I couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Replacing my cadence was our laughter. Rather than my pedaling, the wind carried us further.</p>
<p>I wasn't cycling, we were flying.</p>
<p>When was the last time I laughed so freely?</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Back at our Eden, we watched an orange glow crown the dusk aglow.</p>
<p>Yet, She shone the night.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Cast with a golden shade,
Strands of ink caressing Her jade</p>
<p>Snowy hands, etched from marble
Enchanting eyes, tears from a goddess</p>
<p>Her lips parted, giving way to light
Her lines danced, granting me sight</p>
<p>Skies spewed sparks as She graced the clouds,
Winds sang symphony as She leaped the ashes</p>
<p>Heaven's jealousy.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>woe is he
he who sees
he who yearns
for what he cannot</p>
<p>though artists stroke
bards enchant
poets lavish
all in vain</p>
<p><em>Pygmalion</em></p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Turn.</p>
<p>Eyes.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Though a picture worth thousand words,
words unsaid carry a life.</p>
<p>‘I did not die, and yet I lost life’s breath.’</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>In Her dewy eyes, was a fog.</p>
<p>In Her unrestrained smile, was a pause.</p>
<p>In Her perky ears, was a droop.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Grabbing a leaf She said, &quot;We're like leaves. Falling the moment we're born, destined to lay the ground. But amidst this fall, the wind blows us to places unforeseen.&quot;</p>
<p>Shedding Her laughter was a glimpse. A glimpse of stories untold, breaths forsaken, prayers hollowed.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad the wind blew me to you.&quot;</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Fiddling with Her leaf, I lay in bed. The day passed was a dream for the years.</p>
<p>Would She be there again?</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>Whir. Whir. Whir.</p>
<p>Beep. Beep. Beep.</p>
<p>Cacophony of life, or lack thereof, filled the circle.</p>
<p>Nine doctors circled an <em>angel</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>angel</em> slipped through their crevice.</p>
<p>Beeeep.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p><em>snip</em></p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Roll.</p>
<p>A yo-yo cut from its string rolls.</p>
<p>Rolls where the wind blows.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Huff. Huff. Huff.</p>
<p>A leaf never seemed so fragile. Her rosy red lips, now a bloodless gray. Her vibrant frame, now a stringless marionette.</p>
<p>Haaa.</p>
<p>I could only let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>Even as She lay cold, devoid of life, Her spirit couldn't be killed.</p>
<p><em>Smile</em></p>
<p>She slept with a smile.</p>
<p>Laying beside Her was a letter.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>If you're reading this, it means I'm laying beneath the tree, alongside the other leaves.</p>
<p>Sometimes I ask my nurse, &quot;What does the sun, the air, the grass feel like?&quot;</p>
<p>But you see that tree outside? When the wind blows, some of the leaves fly away. Far from this sterile place.</p>
<p>Maybe one day, the wind will take me away. Dancing in the breeze like the leaves.</p>
<p>There's not much to do here, so I listen. Listen to the wind, the trees, the leaves. Because when you stop talking, the world starts whispering.</p>
<p>If you listen closely, the leaves laugh as they fall. They laugh for freedom. They laugh for flying. They laugh for being.</p>
<p>The leaves don't cry, curse their fate to face the earth. They laugh. And so will I.</p>
<p>Some leaves float,
While others drop.</p>
<p>Some turn gold,
While others go cold.</p>
<p>I can't say I had the longest flight,
But I have seen the light.</p>
<p>We've flown past herds like the birds,
Worked those slants like the ants,
Sang our breeze like the trees.</p>
<p>When the wind blows,
Your sorrow goes.</p>
<p>Please, let it go.</p>
<p>Close your eyes,
Hear their whisper.</p>
<p>When the leaves fall,
Laugh on my behalf.</p>
<p>Because I flew,
laughing.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>The heavens were jealous. Jealous of Her unmarred spirit, jealous of Her carefree laugh, jealous of Her unwavering strength.</p>
<p>Jealous She defied fate.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Yesterday, I learned to live.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I learned leaves laugh while falling.</p>
