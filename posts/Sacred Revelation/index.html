        <p>#Poetry #Religion</p>
<p>Award: Gold Key (Scholastic Art and Writing Awards – Nationals)</p>
<p>Intro: The poem was influenced by a writing session done in the church at night. Seeing the stars shining through the glass panes, I was driven to write this poem.</p>
<p>In a sacred scene, Mother Mary’s tender touch, Caresses Jesus Christ, a love that means so much. Apostle Paul, his voice resounds, preaching to the crowd, Words of faith and hope, his message ringing loud.</p>
<p>But Christ, upon the cross, begins to fade away, His sacrifice unfolding on that vengeful day. A pure glass radiates, with holy aurora gleaming, An ethereal light, a divine presence beaming.</p>
<p>The masses bow in reverence, their spirits deeply moved, Cherubim with feathered blades, their faces gently soothed. A cross crashes onto the stage, a symbol fierce and strong, Pillars explode, the sky darkens, a moment fraught with wrong.</p>
<p>The crow’s screech pierces the air, a mournful cry is heard, Death’s presence lingers, an inferno’s wrath incurred. Hades beckons, souls in turmoil, seeking solace and release, A haunting reminder of life’s transient peace.</p>
<p>In this evocative moment, emotions intertwine, The divine and earthly, the sacred and sublime. A tapestry of faith and fear, hope and despair, A glimpse into the depths of humanity’s shared prayer.</p>
