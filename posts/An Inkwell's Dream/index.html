        <p>#Poetry #Book #Flow</p>
<p>Award: Silver Key (Scholastic Art and Writing Awards)</p>
<p>Intro: Drawn by the mystical alure of books, I have devoted myself to traversing the myriad of realms and dimensions that transcend the confines of a book. A humble attempt at capturing the ineffable beauty of books, this piece is a testament to the transformative power of books.</p>
<p>Once, birds sang their songs, but now they're still, The retreating sunlight bids its farewell, a gentle thrill. Night's chill arrives, greeting me in this familiar space, Where thoughts and ideas dance, finding their place.</p>
<p>Tales of gods, heroes, loss, and reunion untold, Ink on paper, emotions, and tears unfold. Scratch, scratch, scratch, a quill swiftly writes, On the table, crumpled papers, a writer's fights.</p>
<p>In a neglected room, a damp and musty smell, Draw closer, and time seems to halt its journey, as well. The man and his quill exist, everything else fades away, Years pass, until the magnum opus sees the light of day.</p>
<p>The book yearns to be opened, waiting to be read, As I approach with hesitation, afraid to tread. Am I qualified to enter this sacred realm? To touch the purity of words, the author's overwhelming helm?</p>
<p>I reach out and touch the book, instantly drawn inside, Into the author's world, where ideas and words collide. In Athens, I find myself amidst brilliant minds, Socrates, Leonardo, Plato, sharing thoughts that bind.</p>
<p>Flown to the gladiators, their fate hanging in the air, The sand, the heat, the crowd's deafening cheer. Then, a dark forest, wind breezing by my armor, Marching alongside soldiers, feeling their valor.<br>
Traveling through worlds, living different lives, From inferno to paradise, where destiny thrives. Suddenly, my eyes open, flooding light into my room, Awakening from the dream, back from the extraordinary gloom.</p>
