<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>How do you want to spend your summer? Most choose to lounge around, sleep in, and rot away in bed, but this doesn't have to be you! Imagine spending your summer making a real difference in your community while meeting national leaders and fellow changemakers. That's exactly what the Bank of America Student Leaders program offers. As one of the 315 students chosen from thousands of applicants across the nation, I embarked on an 8-week journey that would shape my perspective on leadership, service, and community impact.</p>
<p>The program isn't just another internship – it's a launchpad for future leaders. It combines a paid internship at a local non-profit with an all-expenses-paid week-long summit in Washington, D.C. It's about exploring the interplay of non-profits, businesses, and government in shaping our communities. It's about forging connections with like-minded peers and learning from inspirational figures. If you're a high school junior or senior looking for a summer experience that will resonate far beyond those eight weeks, keep reading – you're about to discover why the Bank of America Student Leaders program might be your perfect next step.</p>

<h2>Non-profit Internship</h2>
<h4>Day in the Life at Feeding America</h4>
<p>My first day at Feeding America, the non-profit I interned at, I walked in expecting to file papers and make coffee. Instead, I found myself diving deep into data that could potentially change thousands of lives. As the &quot;School Nutrition Program Intern,&quot; I was tasked with analyzing school meal data – a project that opened my eyes to the critical role of nutrition in education.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Many children rely on school meals as their only source of nutrition, but schools are cost-prohibited from offering these meals.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My work involved running data analysis on school meals, finding correlations between enrollment in government school meal programs and the number of students fed. With support from community members and colleges, I had the privilege of creating my state's first database of CEP (Community Eligibility Provision) enrollment analysis.</p>
<h4>Skill Development</h4>
<p>When I started, I had never touched Excel. By the end, I was an Excel wizard, even dabbling in Python and machine learning to enhance my data analysis. This growth wasn't just about adding skills to my resume – it was about equipping myself with tools to make a tangible impact. Through this internship program, you <em>will</em> learn invaluable skills for life.</p>
<h4>Non-profit Behind the Scenes</h4>
<p>This internship gave me an insider's view of how non-profits operate. The complexity and intricacy involved in changing communities were eye-opening. It wasn't just about good intentions – it was about strategic planning, data-driven decision making, and relentless dedication. As someone who volunteers regularly, I thought I knew all about community service and impact, but there was so much more behind the scenes. If you're passionate about service and changing your community, I highly recommend this program.</p>
<h4>Impact</h4>
<p>Throughout the internship, I was reminded time and time again that my work had an impact. I wasn't working on projects that would be scrapped or given busy-work, I was changing lives and fighting for a cause I'm personally invested in. My work culminated in a 12-page report that is being shared with national non-profits in this space like No Kid Hungry and FRAC. Furthermore, policymakers and advocates for school meal programs are using my data analysis and report to advocate at the state and national level for improved school meal programs. This internship wasn't about padding resumes or making money, it was about changing and impacting my community.</p>
<h2>DC Summit</h2>
<p>The week-long summit in Washington, D.C. was, without a doubt, the highlight of the program. It was a whirlwind of seminars, workshops, and exploration that painted a vivid picture of how our government operates and the role of businesses and non-profits in shaping policy and community.</p>
<h4>Seminars</h4>
<p>From Chris Evans (yes, Captain America himself) to Senators, CEOs, and renowned film directors, our seminar speakers were a diverse group of inspirational leaders. Each session focused on a different topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental health awareness</li>
<li>Breaking down societal barriers</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship in the modern age</li>
<li>The intersection of policy and community action</li>
<li>Importance of political and community advocacy</li>
</ul>
<p>These interactive sessions didn't just lecture at us – they engaged us in dialogue, challenging our perspectives and inspiring us to think bigger.</p>
<h4>Small Group Workshops</h4>
<p>Our small group workshops were the perfect complement to the high-energy seminars. In these intimate settings, we reflected on what we'd learned, debated policies, and explored how we could bring change to our communities. These groups became a safe space for open dialogue and personal growth.</p>
<p>Spending a week with my workshop, I came to see them as a close-knit family of students, many of whom I still contact today.</p>
<h4>DC Exploration</h4>
<p>Walking the same streets as our nation's leaders, past and present, was a surreal experience. From the awe-inspiring Lincoln Memorial to the treasure troves in the Smithsonian museums, every moment in D.C. was breathtaking.</p>
<p>One of my favorite moments was standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial, striking poses for the Instagram post (@07kyh). But as I lowered my camera, the magnitude of where I stood hit me. These iconic sites, while perfect for photos, carried a profound sense of history and responsibility. Walking through the memorials, I couldn't help but feel the weight of the decisions made within the walls of DC and contemplate the responsibility that we, as future leaders, would one day bear.</p>
<h2>Tips for Applying</h2>
<p>If you're considering applying (and I wholeheartedly think you should), here are some tips to make your application shine:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Embody the Motto: Serve, Inspire, Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The motto was <em>heavily</em> emphasized during the summit</li>
<li>Highlight specific instances where you've served your community</li>
<li>Share stories of how you've inspired others</li>
<li>Demonstrate tangible changes you've made, no matter how small</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show Passion, Not Just Accomplishments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of listing achievements, connect them to your genuine passions</li>
<li>Example: Don't just say you started a club; explain why that cause matters to you</li>
<li>Everyone in this program is accomplished, so listing achievements won't make you stand out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start Early, Finish Strong</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Begin brainstorming and writing months before the deadline</li>
<li>Underestimating the length of the application is a big mistake many make</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prep for Interviews Like a Pro</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Research Bank of America's community engagement initiatives</li>
<li>Prepare your &quot;selling points&quot; – what makes you unique?</li>
<li>Have a &quot;pitch&quot; for your initiatives/main selling point</li>
<li>Practice with a friend or mentor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
