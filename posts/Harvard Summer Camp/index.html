<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This summer, I had the remarkable opportunity to attend Harvard’s Pre-College summer camp, an intensive two-week program focused on growth and knowledge. As I write this post at the airport, I am still awed by the two weeks of enlightenment I experienced through this camp. Through the classes and passport activities, I was able to savor every moment spent at the camp. I hope to share some of my experiences and thoughts about Harvard’s Pre-College summer camp.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>I took the “Democracy, Development, and Violence: An Introduction to Comparative Politics” class. The class aimed to introduce the world of comparative politics through comprehensive readings, class discussions, and lectures. All these aspects synergized to create two weeks of profound learning.</p>
<p>Every day, we were assigned textbook readings and exploratory readings. The textbook readings were generally around 50-100 pages in size and were drawn from various comparative politics books and papers. These texts consisted of various political theories and concepts that laid the groundwork for the lectures and discussions. Though challenging in terms of length, vocabulary, and theory, it was quite intriguing to delve into the world of comparative politics.</p>
<p>In addition to the daily textbook reading, we were assigned an exploration reading. The exploratory readings were a selection of research papers that delved into specific topics and case studies. For example, one of the exploratory readings I chose delved into economic policies promoting growth with the Asian Tigers as the case study. These exploratory readings allowed us to dive deeper into specific topics we were interested in and explore them with a comparative politics lens.</p>
<p>In class, we would hold daily discussions about our day’s readings. Within small groups, we would discuss our exploration readings, creating a space to reflect on the reading and teach our peers. We would then discuss the readings as a whole class. Through these discussions, we were able to broaden our perspectives on the readings and gain an even deeper understanding of the topic at hand. I particularly enjoyed these discussions as everyone had the chance to share their insights, often relating the readings to their own experiences.</p>
<p>The final aspect of the class was the lectures. Though the term &quot;lectures&quot; may sound intimidating, our professor made them anything but intimidating. The lectures focused on the day's textbook reading, with the professor explaining the discussed topics and delving even deeper. Through slideshow presentations, the use of the blackboard, and real-world examples, the lectures were intuitive and comprehensive. The professor actively encouraged class participation by prompting students to recall the readings and engage in discussions about the lesson. The lectures were both easy to understand and rich in content. It was evident that the professor was both knowledgeable and passionate about the topics. The professor broke down complex theories and topics into digestible bits that came together to form the big picture.</p>
<p>I am genuinely surprised and taken aback by how much I have learned in the past two weeks. Although I entered this class with a limited background in politics, I now emerge with an expansive and comprehensive understanding of comparative politics. The rate at which I was able to learn and acquire knowledge was nothing short of miraculous. The readings, class discussions, and lectures created a unique formula through which I was able to achieve rapid growth. I have no doubt that the knowledge and passion for comparative politics I gained in this class will assist me in my future endeavors.</p>
<h2>Passport Activities</h2>
<p>The passport activities are a set of eight different activities that aim to encompass various aspects of college life and encourage the formation of new connections. These activities fall into four different categories: academic exploration, college readiness, social and residential activities, and trips/recreation.</p>
<p>The academic exploration passport activities were special workshops that offered us a glimpse into different professional fields. These events were led by professors who explained various aspects of their fields and professions. Personally, I attended the &quot;Anatomy of Clinical Study&quot; and &quot;Improving How We Work with Data Analytics&quot; seminars. I found these events particularly helpful and interesting because we received firsthand testimonies about their fields and the nature of their work. In the case of the clinical study seminar, the professor discussed how research is conducted and published, providing unique insights into the arduous process. In the case of the data analytics class, the professor explained the unique applications of data analytics in various fields and methods of utilizing data analytics.</p>
<p>The college readiness passport activities were designed to prepare students for college and their professional lives. This was achieved through various seminars focused on teaching essential skills such as note-taking, test-taking, effective reading, and communication. I participated in the &quot;Raising Your Communication Game&quot; and &quot;Critical Thinking: Reading Effectively, Note-Taking, &amp; Test Taking&quot; seminars. These seminars proved to be immensely helpful in preparing me for college life. I gained insights into different aspects of college life and greatly benefited from the tips and tricks provided by the professors.</p>
<p>The social and residential activities passport activities encouraged the meeting of new people and connecting with peers. These events pushed everyone out of their comfort zones, facilitating interactions with new individuals. Personally, I chose the &quot;Awkward Prom&quot; and &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; as my two activities. Through these events, I stepped out of my comfort zone and met new people. I found these activities instrumental in fostering new connections. To be honest, I hadn't actively sought out new people during my time at the camp, and these activities provided an environment where forming connections was made easier.</p>
<p>The trips and recreational passport activities played a significant role in creating a sense of community and nurturing friendships. These events provided us with the opportunity to explore our community with our peers. I personally opted for the Boston trip and Canobie Lake Park excursions, both of which I wholeheartedly recommend. Through these excursions, I made new friends and strengthened existing bonds. The degree of freedom and autonomy granted to us was both surprising and delightful. This autonomy added to the college experience and introduced an element of exploration that would otherwise not have been possible.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My experience at Harvard’s Pre-College summer camp was truly unforgettable. The knowledge gained, connections forged, and memories created are elements I will cherish forever. The insights and experiences I've gained from this camp are immeasurable, and I extend my gratitude to all those who contributed to making this experience as wonderful as it was. Once again, I am reminded that the pursuit of knowledge is an unending journey of a lifetime.</p>
