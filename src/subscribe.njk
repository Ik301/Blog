        <p>
            Once a month, I share one piece of writingâ€”an essay exploring the convergence of disciplines, a poem born from personal experience, or a reflection on the questions that won't let me sleep.
        </p>

        <p>
            But it's more than just content. Each letter includes the honest thoughts I've been wrestling with, the books that have disrupted my thinking, and the connections I'm discovering between seemingly unrelated ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're drawn to rigorous thinking, questions without answers, honest reflections, and writing that connects, then I'd love for you to join this ongoing conversation.
        </p>
