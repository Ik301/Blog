# About
My name is Isaac, and this is where I think out loud.

I'm a student at Princeton studying Financial Engineering and Philosophy—a combination that raises eyebrows but captures exactly what this space is about: the belief that seemingly disparate fields are actually different languages describing the same underlying reality.

What started in 2022 as a simple learning log has become something more ambitious: an exploration of how the intellectual, personal, and spiritual dimensions of life illuminate each other.

# The Philosophy
Every field of human inquiry—from physics to poetry, theology to technology—is an attempt to grasp truth. Each discipline offers a unique lens, but I believe they're all looking at the same light.

This conviction shapes how I approach three interconnected domains:
> The Intellectual is the realm of rigorous analysis and structured knowledge. Here you'll find deep dives into AI architectures, book syntheses that changed my thinking, and frameworks for navigating complex systems. It's the pursuit of clarity through careful reasoning.

> The Personal is the realm of lived experience and honest reflection. This is where my poetry on belonging lives alongside essays on relationships, identity, and the messy process of becoming. It's the pursuit of authenticity through vulnerable exploration.

> The Spiritual is the realm of ultimate questions and transcendent meaning. It's the thread that runs through everything else—the conviction that our intellectual and personal journeys are actually spiritual ones, pointing us toward something infinitely larger than ourselves.

# The Invitation
This blog is my attempt to connect the dots between these worlds, to show how a sermon can illuminate a physics problem, how a poem can unlock a philosophical puzzle, how personal struggle can deepen spiritual understanding.

Whether you leave with a new insight, a lingering question, or simply a moment of quiet reflection, you've engaged with what matters most: the ongoing conversation between mind, heart, and soul.

Thank you for thinking alongside me.
