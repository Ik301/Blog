# About
My name is Isaac, and this blog is my online notebook.

I'm a student at Princeton University, where I study Financial Engineering and Philosophy—a combination that often gets a curious look, but one that sits at the very heart of this project. It began in 2022 as a place to document my learnings, but has since evolved into something more: an exploration of the connections that bind all fields of human experience.

This space is dedicated to the convergence of three fundamental domains: the intellectual, the personal, and the spiritual.

# The Philosophy
I believe that every field of human endeavor—from physics to poetry, theology to technology—is an attempt to understand a single, underlying truth—God. Each discipline is a different language trying to describe the same ineffable reality. Each identity is a unique lens through which to see the same light.

This is the convergence I seek to explore:

> The Intellectual is the realm of logic, analysis, and structured knowledge. It’s the "how" and the "what." Here, you’ll find technical breakdowns of AI models, summaries of paradigm-shifting books, and strategic guides for navigating complex systems. It is the pursuit of clarity.

> The Personal is the realm of lived experience, emotion, and identity. It’s the "who." This is where my poetry on belonging, essays on relationships, and reflections on my own journey live. It is the pursuit of authenticity.

> The Spiritual is the realm of meaning, purpose, and our connection to something larger than ourselves. It’s the ultimate "why." This undercurrent shapes my questions about what makes a life well-lived and my conviction that all paths of inquiry can lead back to a single, creative source. It is the pursuit of meaning.

This blog is my process of collecting and connecting the dots between these worlds. It is an invitation for you to do the same. Whether you leave with a new insight, a lingering question, or simply a moment of quiet contemplation, my goal is achieved.

Thank you for thinking alongside me.
