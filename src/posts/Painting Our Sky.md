#Poetry #Sky #Nature #Draft

Canvas lay with a scroll unrolled
Strokes from above

Musing with a glance, He soaks
Hint of a ripen peach

Such wouldnâ€™t be grown on green
Only in the coral simmerings

Glimpses behind a veil
Dashes of light bestowed in ink

Laying hair, settling dust
He lowers a gaze

Beholding heavens we raise
