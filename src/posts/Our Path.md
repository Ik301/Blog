#Poetry #Love #Longing

We walked that path, side by side.

We greeted the birds, singing sorrows away.
We woke the sun, sharing our day.

We sang those songs, moving our sway.
We shared those days, hoping it'll stay.
/
I walk that path, step by step.

I greet the birds, singing in daze.
I wake the sun, bringing lonely days.

I sing these songs, hanging my lips,
I hate these days, facing its grips.
/
Do you walk, down that path?

Greet those birds, wake the sun?
Sing those songs, make the day?
/
It's not us, you're no more.
It's not me, not anymore.

So who is that, walking our path?
