#Poetry #Divine #Art

From above we came,
in His likeness,
for His being

Like shattered glass,
We reflect a piece of divine

Like shattered glass,
We scatter amok

Artists and poets,
Bards and dancers,
We seek the scattered

Bit by bit,
Piece by piece,
Fragments of a divine soul

Like a webbed mirror,
We reflect

A shine,
A garment,
A cry

We reflect the Creator with fragments of glass,
Come together shattered beings of light
