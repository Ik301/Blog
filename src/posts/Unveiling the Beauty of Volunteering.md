#Blog #Reflection-Insight 

## Introduction

As the curtain falls on an eventful summer, I find myself pausing to reflect on these fleeting months—specifically, the tapestry of moments woven through my summer of volunteering. Amid the kaleidoscope of experiences, one truth emerges: this summer has kindled a profound revelation about the beauty of service.

My summer volunteering comprised of three roles: elementary school summer camp, Discovery World Summer camp, and Discovery World VR. Despite being swamped with responsibilities, I was able to devote a total of 90 hours to volunteering over the course of the summer. I wanted to share some realizations, thoughts, and experiences I had during my time volunteering.

## Exploring My Roles

Before I talk about my experience, I wanted to explain what my roles pertained. I had three different roles with very different responsibilities and experiences.

My role as an elementary school summer camp volunteer was one of, frankly, exhaustion and energy. My role was laughably simple – play with the campers and aid with the arts and crafts. Despite the task’s simplicity, the tasks proved quite exhausting in the sun’s relentless batter.

As a Discovery World summer camp volunteer, I was tasked with “assisting the teacher with whatever they need”. Indeed, the description was quite vague, but my role was quite broad in nature. From taking kids to the bathroom, handing out paper, and preserving a semblance of peace (an effort proved futile), I was essentially a teacher’s assistant. As my days in school are spent as a “student” and not a “teacher”, I rarely get the chance to be in a classroom from the perspective of a teacher.

Meanwhile, my mantle as a VR Docent at Discovery World saw me embracing an array of responsibilities. I guided guests into the realms of virtual reality, elucidated gaming choices, facilitated setup, and ensured their exit, all while maintaining the pristine state of headsets.

## Personal Insight

To be honest and quite frank, my time spent volunteering wasn't always illuminated by sunshine and rainbows. There were moments when fatigue, annoyance, and even frustration cast shadows over my experience. Yet, it was within this realm of exhaustion and the crucible of irritation that a revelation took shape – an epiphany forged amidst discomfort. As I navigated through the desert of challenges, it dawned on me that my life has been graced by remarkable individuals who have invested their time and efforts to sculpt the person I am today. Through the act of volunteering and extending a helping hand amidst my own bustling schedule, I uncovered a fresh perspective. I was hit with an epiphany, the immense contributions others have made to my journey of growth and accomplishment were suddenly illuminated. A newfound appreciation bloomed for the significant people in my life, igniting a fierce motivation within me – a drive to aspire for excellence and a commitment to extending aid to those in need.

To say that my eyes had a veil uncover them would be an understatement. The transformation and realization I had during my experience volunteering was nothing short of enlightening. In my 90 hours of volunteering, I constantly found myself laughing, smiling, and genuinely enjoying myself. Rather than feeling like a chore, my time volunteering felt like a gift, a gift of being able to spend time helping others. Before this summer, I had never felt this ardent about volunteering, though that is not to say I previously didn’t enjoy volunteering. Simply put, this summer has been a transformative period where I was able to find my genuine joy and passion in volunteering and helping others.

## Conclusion

Through my 90 hours of summer volunteering, I was able to experience a transformative summer of gratitude and jubilation. Realizations followed by laughter, volunteering has truly uncovered my eyes and opened my heart in ways I could not fathom.

With these realizations resonating in my heart, I urge you to accept volunteering's warm invite. As you step into this world of service, you step onto a path where your steps echo with purpose and your heart resonates with joy. As my summer draws its final breath, the symphony of volunteering remains, a melody of gratitude and fulfillment that will forever serenade my soul.
