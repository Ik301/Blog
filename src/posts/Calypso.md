drip. drip. drip.
ripples in the water

my frozen beat, thawed

from where you come,
to ripple my peace?
/
one. two. three.
a picture. a laugh. a smile.

echo across my sea

how long will you stay,
how many ripples will you make?
/
pat. pat. pat.
sing me to sleep

become my peace

do I dare to dream,
of a river withheld?
/
. . .
broken peace
brought me ease

but a ripple needs a still,
so I freeze once again

for when a river
thaws my beat.
