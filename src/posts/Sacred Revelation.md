Intro: The poem was influenced by a writing session done in the church at night. Seeing the stars shining through the glass panes, I was driven to write this poem.

In a sacred scene, Mother Mary’s tender touch, Caresses Jesus Christ, a love that means so much. Apostle Paul, his voice resounds, preaching to the crowd, Words of faith and hope, his message ringing loud.

But Christ, upon the cross, begins to fade away, His sacrifice unfolding on that vengeful day. A pure glass radiates, with holy aurora gleaming, An ethereal light, a divine presence beaming.

The masses bow in reverence, their spirits deeply moved, Cherubim with feathered blades, their faces gently soothed. A cross crashes onto the stage, a symbol fierce and strong, Pillars explode, the sky darkens, a moment fraught with wrong.

The crow’s screech pierces the air, a mournful cry is heard, Death’s presence lingers, an inferno’s wrath incurred. Hades beckons, souls in turmoil, seeking solace and release, A haunting reminder of life’s transient peace.

In this evocative moment, emotions intertwine, The divine and earthly, the sacred and sublime. A tapestry of faith and fear, hope and despair, A glimpse into the depths of humanity’s shared prayer.
