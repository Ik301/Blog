#Poetry #Growth 

## Introduction

This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to attend Kenyon's Online Writing Workshop, an immersive week-long experience centered around poetry and creative writing. As I look back on this transformative journey, I find myself filled with gratitude for the knowledge gained, friendships formed, and the creative spark that has been ignited within me. In this blog post, I aim to share my experiences at the camp, from captivating guest speakers and group activities to the enriching workshops that expanded my understanding of writing.

Guest Speakers and Group Activities: 

One of the highlights of the workshop was the presence of esteemed guest speakers Richie Hofmann and Molly McCully Brown. Their virtual reading sessions, along with the insightful Q&A sessions that followed, provided a unique opportunity to delve into the minds of seasoned professionals in the field of writing. It was truly inspiring to hear them share their works and offer valuable insights into their creative processes.

In addition to the guest speakers, the camp organized various group activities that fostered camaraderie among the participants. The meet and greet sessions, participant readings, and the final large group meeting were all platforms where I could connect with fellow writers, share our work, and appreciate each other's talents. These activities created a sense of community and allowed me to form meaningful connections that I will cherish long after the camp.

## Workshops

The heart of the program lay in the engaging and thought-provoking workshops. Each session followed a structured approach that encouraged exploration and growth. We began with a 10-minute free-write, an exercise that unleashed our thoughts onto the page without inhibition. Then, we would share our works and discuss the unique aspects of each piece, nurturing a supportive and collaborative environment.

Throughout the workshop, we delved into various genres of poetry and writing, reading countless works by critically acclaimed authors from around the world. By analyzing their distinct styles and techniques, we gained invaluable insights into the craft. This analysis served as a springboard for our own creative endeavors. Armed with newfound inspiration, we were given prompts that challenged us to incorporate the observed techniques into our own writing.

The workshops not only nurtured my creativity but also helped me overcome writer's block. The prompts provided a fresh perspective and acted as catalysts for my imagination. Sharing our creations with the group fostered a sense of accountability and encouraged me to explore new depths in my writing. Witnessing the diversity of works and hearing the unique voices of my peers further expanded my own horizons as a writer.

As I reflect on this unforgettable experience, I am filled with gratitude for the connections made, the wisdom imparted by the guest speakers, and the guidance provided during the workshops.
