#Poetry #Society #Meaning

Award: Honorable Mention (Scholastic Art and Writing Awards)

Intro: Accolades define our worth in todayâ€™s society, and sacrificing our lives for societal approval seems obvious, even necessary. In light of this societal norm, this piece comments on the futility of societal expectations.

Empty souls, living to die,

Lifeless flesh, too busy to live.

Monotonous faces, slaved to norms,

Unrelenting pressure, suffocated to death.

Chasing success, forgetting happiness,

Defined by accolades, failure shunned.

Futile quest, delusion of happiness,

Racing rats, lives squandered.

Inevitable demise, lived in vain.
