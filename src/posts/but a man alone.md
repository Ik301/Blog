#Poetry #Solitude

He who breathes in the still of night,
Who is he, in the absence of light.
With nobody to see, nobody to hear,
Who is he, but a man alone with his fear.

He cries to God, one who bottles his tears.
Tears they fall, but where is God
Not in his fears.

He cries to man, one who shares his bone.
Stones they hail, but where is man
Not in his fears.

Alas, alas, he cries to self.
Neither God nor man
Not in his fears.

He who weeps in the still of night,
Who is he, drowning in plight.
With nobody to see, nobody to hear,
Who is he, but a man alone in his fear.
