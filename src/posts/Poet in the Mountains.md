#Poetry #Nature 

Simmerings of life rushing below,
Wine to the weary behold

A lone ballad gives rise to chorus,
Seraphim of the forest

Hollow beats in search of nirvana,
Chanting monks in asana

Carved by history and marveled by man,
Stone to see our span

Lay in this eden long enough,
Youâ€™ll find yourself a poet
soon enough
