#Poetry #Longing #Time 

I envision a man, gently rowing his boat
Wooden oars gliding through his passage

I envision a cherry blossom, adorning the branches of fate
Silently adored by a pensive gave

I envision the river, flowing once more
Petals of the tree, flying once more
Gaze of the man, set straight once more

But I see the flowers caressing our sky
Even as he rows along, a petal lands on the wooden oar

Though the man set his sights ahead,
Breeze of memories ripples his river

Upon looking back, he is greeted by
Sakura of memories, fluttering across the sky
Branches of fate, waving across its river
Waters calmed, now a tranquil still

Petals once adored have been adjourned,
To when unbeknownst to man.
But for now, the man lay down his oar,
Rising with melancholy
Of sakura once admired on its branch.
