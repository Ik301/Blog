what is a revolution?
a,
revolution is

to
fathom its heights,
dare not.
yet
scale with
hope, a
faith?

assured of things,
hope becomes faith.

dangerous, that faith
where was it placed?

but I smelled it,
kneaded a dozen.
but I felt it,
a dry cotton.

but I need it,
a,
mirage.

let me chase it,
something,
a,
hope
though false.

you say,
the revolt has failed.

existed—
a,
paradox.
—never.

beyond, lies, 
I saw.

a,
to build atop
the wall
we climbed.

to have fallen,
before zenith,
maybe
a blessing
for the faithful.

a,
vanity.
