when **her** sterling glistens gold,
when *her* scorch burns with warmth,
you know,
She has come.

underneath *her* gaze,
flowing with Her breath,
**she** adorned a transient shade.
**her** skin, silk, strand
fleeting with Her palette.

She comes not
in "the solstice", "changing of leaves", or "biting cold"

She is in
**her** clicking of heels, cinnamon wisp, emboldening leather.

She has come to break my fall,
so I call **her**,
Fall.
