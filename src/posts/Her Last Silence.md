#Fiction #Longing #Love #Loss 

An onyx black sea churned beneath us, it's waters roaring with inferno, yet Her silence spoke louder. Glossy black fire spat from the depths of what should have been calm waters, as if the underworld itself beckoned. Strands of her hair, tinged with ashes, danced in the sulfurous wind. Her eyes, usually the color of dawn, now reflected the burning infernal glow. Standing before the edge, we felt neither fear nor excitement—only silence. A silence we'd never been able to afford in all our years together. Silence from my mortal fate, silence from the echoes of Paradise lost, silence from the whispers of the Creator who cast Her out.

As She gripped my hand, I could hear her pulse flutter like trapped wings—a life force whispering its final song. The veins traced ethereal patterns beneath Her alabaster skin, and that familiar fragrance of divine nectar still clung to Her, even after Her fall. Her touch was cold now, so cold, yet facing the depths of the abyss, She remained otherworldly. I should have known then. Should have seen how Her feet touched earth with a silence no mortal could achieve, how the ashes never quite settled on Her shoulders.

Thump, thump, thump. One glance, one nod, one jump. Gravel crunched beneath our feet, a sharp inhale of our last breath, and lifted by the winds echoing Her name.

Weightless and free, yet grounded and united. Perhaps this was Her dream, soaring through the skies with regained wings—to be an angel once more. And perhaps this was the fulfillment of my own desperate wish—to follow her beyond mortal bounds, to be united with Her one final time.

We were one in that moment, bound by a single dream. We leaped not for the fiery depths but for the star-strewn heavens above. Yet even the most beautiful dreams must end. The winds that had carried us began to fail, and the burning sea reached up with hungry flames.

Bracing for oblivion, I turned for Her embrace. Yet, at that moment, She seemed chasms away. The Fate of mortality and Curse of divinity separated the breath between us. A pitiful smile, eyes deep with sorrow, and in Her last silence, a mouthed 'I'm sorry' that echoed louder than any scream. As She ascended on newly born wings, I understood at last—I had been Her final test, Her path to redemption. The burning depths roared their welcome, while She ascended in divine silence, to Hers.
