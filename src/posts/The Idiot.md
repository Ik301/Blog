#Poetry #Pygmalion #Solitude 

I want to talk about everything with
At least one person as I
Talk about things with
myself.

Longing for a voice, to
Call my own. Not an echo of thoughts, a
Figment of my sought. Cursed by the gods with
Wisdom of God. Never to spend an empty night
But alone in plight. Go from me now,
I cast thee away. Forever go
Thoughts, free me from
myself.

I will never love
'Til the day she comes
Alive. Waken from stone, 
breathe life my goddess, save me from
myself.
