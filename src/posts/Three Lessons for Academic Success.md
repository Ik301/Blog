#Success #Mental-Health #Drive #Hard-work 

## Introduction
My high school career has been defined by extraordinary personal growth. High school has given me both my best and worst moments, all of which have contributed to my development. Junior year, in particular, has been pivotal; not only because it matters most for college applications, but also because it's the year I experienced the most growth. Throughout junior year, I came to understand three important lessons that I wish I had realized sooner. By applying and utilizing these lessons, I believe that everyone's ability to succeed academically and personally will be enhanced.

## Mental Health
The first lesson I learned was the importance of mental health. Naive and unaware, I disregarded academics freshman year and solely focused on my interests. While this resulted in quality time with friends and good mental health, it came at the cost of my academic performance. 

Sophomore year, my immersion into summer programs shook my understanding of academics; I was suddenly thrown out of my comfort zone and into a vast, competitive ocean. For once, I felt "average" compared to my accomplished peers, leading to my academic crusade junior year.

Junior year, my focus shifted solely to academics. Friends, hobbies, and even sleep were luxuries I couldn't afford. Caffeine fueled, 4 am study sessions became the norm as I prioritized studies above all else.

After weeks of constant breakdowns, I realized something had to change. Gradually, I started to prioritize my mental health, finding ways to manage stress. Now that junior year is over, I've come to realize how critical mental health is, especially for driven students. By struggling with and ultimately learning to manage my mental health, I discovered the necessity of balance and self-care.

## Passion and Drive
The second key lesson was the power of passion and drive. True drive is intrinsic and lasting, compelling you forward until you've attained your goals. 

My family's financial struggles ignited an innate drive in me to help them and others in need. Combined with a passion for economics and finance uncovered in my sophomore year, this drove me to study relentlessly despite the toll on my well-being. Passion and drive, not fleeting motivation, enabled me to survive sleepless and stressful days. I've learned that true passion provides deep wells of drive to draw upon.

## Hard Work
Genius is 1% talent and 99% hard work - but the hard work doesn't always pay off how or when you expect. Seeing peers with more resources achieve the same things with seemingly less effort, I often felt discouraged. Yet I had no choice but to work harder. 

Rejection after rejection, I kept telling myself that hard work would be rewarded. Near the end of my grueling application process, I finally earned acceptances to highly selective programs. This demonstrated that hard work does pay off, even if the rewards are different or later than anticipated.

## Moving Forward
These lessons define my growth throughout high school. They were hard-earned through challenges and failures, making their impact all the more profound. As I move forward in my educational journey and in life, I will carry these lessons with me, applying them to overcome future obstacles and continue striving for success and fulfillment. I hope that by sharing them, I can inspire others to persist through their own struggles and hold fast to the beliefs that hard work, passion, drive, and balance can help them achieve their dreams.
